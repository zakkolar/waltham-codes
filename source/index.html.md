# Waltham Codes

We live in a world surrounded by technology. And we know that whatever field our students choose to go into as adults, their ability to succeed will increasingly hinge on understanding how technology works. To prepare students for the future, every school in Waltham is participating in a coding activity during the weeks of December 9-20.

## Why Computer Science?

Every student should have the opportunity to learn computer science. Basic programming activities help nurture creativity and problem solving skills. By starting early, students will have a foundation for success in any future career path. Computer programming jobs are growing 3x faster than students entering the field. Yet fewer schools teach computer science than 10 years ago. 90% of K-12 schools in the United States donâ€™t even teach it.
