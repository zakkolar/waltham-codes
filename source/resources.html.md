# Free Coding Resources

The resources below can help kids (and grown ups!) learn how to code for free in fun and engaging ways outside of school on a variety of devices including smart phones, tablets, and computers.

## ScratchJr

Ages: 5-7
<br>Experience levels: all
<br>Devices: tablets (iOS, Android, and Kindle), Chromebooks

[ScratchJr](https://www.scratchjr.org/) is an app available for tablets (iOS and Android) and Chromebooks. From their website:

> Coding is the new literacy! With ScratchJr, young children (ages 5-7) can program their own interactive stories and games. In the process, they learn to solve problems, design projects, and express themselves creatively on the computer.

Even for pre-readers, ScratchJr is an excellent way to get future computer scientists started early.

## Code.org Play Lab

Ages: 4+
<br>Experience level: beginner
<br>Devices: Web browser based - runs on computers, phones, and tablets

Code.org's [Play Lab](https://studio.code.org/s/playlab/stage/1/puzzle/1) is an excellent way to programming. Whether you're still learning to read or reading  a novel each weekend, this drag-and-drop language is the perfect way to get started with programming. It starts off with tutorials to acquaint learners with the tools, and then allows for creating open-ended projects.

## Scratch

Ages: 8-16
<br>Experience levels: beginner-advanced
<br>Devices: devices that run Flash (mostly computers, some Android devices)
<br>A new version of Scratch is coming out in January 2019, which will support computers, phones, and tablets, even those that don't support Flash.

Scratch is another drag and drop programming language created by MIT. It is one of the most widely-used coding platforms. With version 3.0 just around the corner, Scratch is a great platform for older kids to get their hands dirty with coding. Despite its kid-friendly appearance, Scratch can be used for a wide variety of projects from simple animations to advanced, multi-player games with custom graphics. It inclues an open-ended workspace, tutorials, and access to a library of millions of user-created projects.

## WoofJS

Ages: 12+
<br>Experience levels: intermediate-advanced
<br>Devices: Web browser based, easiest to use from a computer

WoofJS is perfect for people who have mastered Scratch and want to move onto traditional, non-block-based programming languages. It teaches users how to translate Scratch blocks into JavaScript, a programming language that powers much of the web and some desktop and even mobile applications.

## Code.org Hour of Code Activities

Ages: 4-104
<br>Experience levels: all
<br>Devices: assorted

There are far more resources available than can fit on this page. Code.org has a [repository of activities](https://code.org/hourofcode/overview) for Hour of Code, an international initiative to bring computer science into schools. Some of these activities are created and hosted by Code.org and others are curated from other educational computer science providers. This collection has a wide variety of self-contained tutorials and projects for learns of all ages and experience levels, including and beyond elementary school. This is a good resource for trying out coding without having a particular project in mind.
