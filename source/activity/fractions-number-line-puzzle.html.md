In this activity, students explore a block-based programming language called <a href='https://snap.berkeley.edu/' target='_blank'>Snap<i>!</i></a> In this particular programming environment, students are given a set of blocks with which they can add and subtract specific fractions. They are given a series of puzzles that require them to navigate a number line using only these provided blocks. Click "Set 2" under the dinosaur to begin the fraction puzzles. "Set 1" is a review of whole numbers.

This activity is under development by the Education Development Center as part of their [Math + Programming](https://elementarymath.edc.org/programming/) project, funded by the National Science Foundation.


## Visual Programming

Drag-and-drop languages like Snap<i>!</i> bridge computational thinking exercises and writing computer code. Snap<i>!</i> introduces concepts used in more advanced programming languages, such as variables and conditional logic. Through the drag-and-drop interface, students learn the underlying programming logic without worrying about specific technical details required by written programming languages.

Snap<i>!</i> is developed by Berkeley University. It was spun off from <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/' target='_blank'>Scratch</a>, another block-based programming language developed by MIT. 



## Next steps

While Snap<i>!</i> is conducive to custom environments such as those used in this activity, Scratch has become the widest-used block-based language for learning programming. Both languages provide similar blocks suited to beginners, but Scratch has more resources for learning. Scratch has a collection of built-in tutorials for students to learn more advanced concepts. It also has a library of projects created by other users for inspiration.

If your student wants to continue programming with Scratch, help them create a [free account](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
