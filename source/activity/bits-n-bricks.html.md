title: Bits 'n' Bricks
---
Bit is a little, very adventurous LEGO® robot, but as with all small creatures, sometimes Bit cannot get its programs right. You can help Bit solve the challenges by figuring out which programs are needed. You do this by creating a sequence of small behavior blocks that tells Bit what to do.

## Computational Thinking

This activity helps students think like programmers by breaking a problem down into individual steps. They use LEGO's® coding interface to translate these steps into instructions a computer can understand. They watch the computer complete their instructions and note any areas in need of debugging (fixing errors in code). As students continue to solidify their computational thinking, they can solve more complex problems using more complex languages.
