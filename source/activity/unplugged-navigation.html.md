title: Unplugged Navigation
---
Computer scientists spend time breaking problems into smaller problems until all that remains is a list of steps. These steps can be turned into instructions that a computer can understand.

This activity laid a foundation for students to think computationally so that they can eventually solve problems by writing code.

## Navigating a Grid

Students were given a 5x5 grid with a start point, finish point, and obstacles:


![5 by 5 navigation grid with images of traffic cones as obstacles for students to avoid. "Start" and "Finish" are labeled in opposite corners.](/images/uploads/unplugged-navigation-grid.jpg){: .img-400}

Using cards with different arrows, students worked in groups to create a list of instructions to move from the start to the finish without running into obstacles. They tested their instructions at their own grids and debugged (made changes to solve problems) as necessary.

At the end of the class, some groups tested their instructions by navigating a teacher through a large version of the grid with the same configuration.
