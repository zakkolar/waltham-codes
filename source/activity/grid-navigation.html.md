title: Grid Navigation
---

Computer scientists spend time breaking problems into smaller problems until all that remains is a list of steps. These steps can be turned into instructions that a computer can understand.

This activity lays a foundation for students to think computationally so that they can eventually solve problems by writing code. We completed the grid navigation activity in class and students were given a take-home version to continue "coding" outside of school. No device is necessary! Scroll down to see the [materials and instructions for the take-home version](#take-home-activity).

## In class activity

Students were given a 5x5 grid with a start point, finish point, and obstacles:


![5 by 5 navigation grid with images of traffic cones as obstacles for students to avoid. "Start" and "Finish" are labeled in opposite corners.](/images/uploads/grid-navigation-digital.png){: style='max-width:300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;'}

Using cards with different arrows, students created a list of instructions to move from the start to the finish without running into obstacles. They tested their instructions at their own grids and debugged (made changes to solve problems) as necessary.

At the end of the class, some groups tested their instructions by translating them into [Snap*!*](https://snap.berkeley.edu/){: _target='_blank'} code and running them on a [Finch](https://www.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/){: target='_blank'} robot.

## Take-home activity

To see the materials or print more copies, you can do so [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S7mOSWL2e_y9tik7MfE6TOyTafUp_x6DcYcL9huPacw/export?format=pdf).

### Directions

1. Cut out the arrows and repeat blocks.
2. Pick a puzzle to solve
3. Use the arrows to write step-by-step instructions for a person to move from the “start” to the “end” without stepping on any obstacles or leaving the grid
   
   <div class="fl w-33 pa1 tc">
    <img class='h4-l h3-m h3' src='/images/uploads/up_arrow.png' alt='Arrow pointing up'>
    <p>Step forward</p>
   </div>
   <div class="fl w-33 pa1 tc">
    <img  class='h4-l h3-m h3' src='/images/uploads/turn_right.png' alt='Arrow pointing right'>
    <p>Turn right (90 degrees) and step</p>
   </div>
   <div class="fl w-33 pa1 tc">
    <img  class='h4-l h3-m h3' src='/images/uploads/turn_left.png' alt='Arrow pointing left'>
    <p>Turn left (90 degrees) and step</p>
   </div>
   <div class='cb'></div>
4. If you need to use the same arrow more than one time in a row, you can put it on top of a repeat block:

    ![Block with an upward arrow labeled "repeat 3 times"](/images/uploads/repeat_3_times.png){: class='w4 center db'}

5. After you solve all the puzzles, use the blank grid and cones on the last page to create your own!

### Example:

<h4 class='tc'>Puzzle</h4> 

![Image of a 3x3 grid. The bottom left box is labeled 'start'. The top right box is labeled 'finish'. The center boxes in the middle and bottom rows contain images of traffic cones.](/images/uploads/example_grid_puzzle.png){: class='w5 center db'}


<h4 class='tc'>Instructions/code</h4>

By following these steps, a person can get from “Start” to “Finish”

![Block with an upward arrow labeled "repeat 2 times"](/images/uploads/repeat_2_times.png){: class='w4 center db'}

<p class='tc'>Step forward two times</p>


![Arrow pointing right](/images/uploads/turn_right.png){: class='w4 center db'}
<p class='tc'>Turn right and step</p>


![Arrow pointing up](/images/uploads/up_arrow.png){: class='w4 center db'}
<p class='tc'>Step forward</p>
