# Number line puzzle

In this activity, students explore a block-based programming language called <a href='https://snap.berkeley.edu/' target='_blank'>Snap!</a> In this particular programming environment (under development by the <a href='https://www.edc.org/' target='_blank'>Education Development Center)</a>, students are given a set of blocks with which they can add and subtract 3 and 5. They are given a series of puzzles that require them to navigate a number line using only these provided blocks.

## Visual Programming

Drag-and-drop languages like Snap! bridge computational thinking exercises and writing computer code. Snap! introduces concepts used in more advanced programming languages, such as variables and conditional logic. Through the drag-and-drop interface, students learn the underlying programming logic without worrying about specific technical details required by written programming languages.

Snap! is developed by Berkeley University. It was spun off from <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/' target='_blank'>Scratch</a>, another block-based programming language developed by MIT.

Note: this activity only works on computers, not phones or tablets. For a list of free coding devices that work on a variety of devices (and others that don't require a device at all), visit the [Free Coding Resources page](/resources).

## Next steps

While Snap! is conducive to custom environments such as those used in this activity, Scratch has become the widest-used block-based language for learning programming. Both languages provide similar blocks suited to beginners, but Scratch has more resources for learning. Scratch has a collection of built-in tutorials for students to learn more advanced concepts. It also has a library of projects created by other users for inspiration.

If your student wants to continue programming with Scratch, help them create a [free account](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
