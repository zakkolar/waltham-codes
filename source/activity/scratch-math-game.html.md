## Activity

In this activity, students used a drag-and-drop programming language called [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), developed by MIT, to create a game that quizzed the player with math questions. The only requirements for the game were to include at least three math questions and to keep track of the score in some way. Students chose their own story, characters, setting, and other embellishments for their games.

## Visual Programming

Drag-and-drop languages like Scratch bridge computational thinking exercises and writing computer code. Scratch introduces concepts used in traditional programming languages such as variables and conditional logic. Through the drag-and-drop interface, students learn the underlying programming logic without worrying about specific technical details required by written programming languages such as punctuation marks.

Scratch can be used to create anything from simple animations to advanced, multiplayer games with custom graphics.

## Next Steps

Scratch has a collection of built-in tutorials for students to learn more advanced concepts. It also has a [library](https://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/all) of projects created by other users for inspiration and [tutorials](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all) to get started.

If your student wants to continue programming with Scratch, you can help them create a [free account](https://scratch.mit.edu/). It is also possible to create programs without an account, although not all features will be available.
