In this activity, students used a drag-and-drop programming language called [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), developed by MIT, to create a racing game that quizzed the player with math questions. Each grade level began with a project template, which they completed and customized to make the game their own.

## Visual Programming

Drag-and-drop languages like Scratch bridge computational thinking exercises and writing computer code. Scratch introduces concepts used in more advanced programming languages, such as variables and conditional logic. Through the drag-and-drop interface, students learn the underlying programming logic without worrying about specific technical details required by written programming languages.

Scratch can be used to create anything from simple animations to advanced, multiplayer games with custom graphics.

## Next Steps

Scratch has a collection of built-in tutorials for students to learn more advanced concepts. It also has a library of projects created by other users for inspiration.

If your student wants to continue programming with Scratch, help them create a [free account](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
