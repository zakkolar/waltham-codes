title: My Robotic Friends
---
Computer scientists spend time breaking problems into smaller problems until all that remains is a list of steps. These steps can be turned into instructions that a computer can understand.

This activity lays a foundation for students to think computationally so that they can eventually solve problems by writing code. We completed the My Robotic Friends activity in class and students were given a take-home version to continue "coding" outside of school. No device is necessary! Scroll down to see the [materials and instructions for the take-home version](#take-home-activity).

## In class activity

Students worked in groups, with some acting as programmers and others as robots. The programmers chose a pattern of stacked cups and needed to write instructions for the robots to re-create the pattern.

Using cards with different arrows, the programmers "programmed" the robots to move the cups from the initial stack into the pattern.


## Take-home activity

To see the materials or print more copies, you can do so [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IXMAygJEPEMwQ2QFnHEFYzTeWX935HFWChyYI0MIWg/export?format=pdf).

### Directions

1. Cut out the arrows, repeat blocks, and cup patterns.
2. Each person/team should choose a cup stacking pattern card without letting the other person/team see.
3. Use the arrows to write step-by-step instructions for the opposite person/team arrange the cups. Instructions for each cup goes on its own line.
   
   <div class="fl w-20 pa1 tc">
    <img src='/images/uploads/up_arrow.png' alt='Arrow pointing up'>
    <p>Pick up cup</p>
   </div>
   <div class="fl w-20 pa1 tc">
    <img src='/images/uploads/down_arrow.png' alt='Arrow pointing dowm'>
    <p>Put down cup</p>
   </div>
   <div class="fl w-20 pa1 tc">
    <img src='/images/uploads/left_arrow.png' alt='Arrow pointing left'>
    <p>Step back 1 space</p>
   </div>
   <div class="fl w-20 pa1 tc">
    <img src='/images/uploads/right_arrow.png' alt='Arrow pointing right'>
    <p>Step forward 1 space</p>
   </div>
   <div class="fl w-20 pa1 tc">
    <img src='/images/uploads/redo_arrow.png' alt='Arrow pointing in a U-turn'>
    <p>Grab a new cup</p>
   </div>
   
   <div class='cb'></div>
    
   Each step is half the width of a cup so that the cups can be offset when placed on top of each other. The original stack of cups sits directly to the left of the first step:
   
   ![Cups stacked in a pyramid with lines labeling each step. The first step starts at the edge of the pyramid, the second step is a half-cup length to the right, and steps continue in half-cup lengths](/images/uploads/cups_layout.png){:class='img-400' }
   
   The placemat in the packet can help with cup placement. It shows a view of the cups from above, where the dashed circles represent spaces for cups in the second row.
   
   ![Image of the placemat included in the packet. Five overlapping circles are labeled 1 through 5. Circles 2 and 4 are shown in dashed lines. At the bottom of the placemat, the five arrows described above are shown.](/images/uploads/placemat_preview.png){:class='img-400' }
   
   
   
      
   
4. If you need to use the same arrow more than one time in a row, you can put it on top of a repeat block:

    ![Block with an right-facing arrow labeled "repeat 3 times"](/images/uploads/repeat_right_3_times.png){: class='w4 center db'}



### Example:

<h4 class='tc'>Cup stack card</h4> 

![Image of a pyramid of cups. Two cups are on the bottom, one cup is centered on top of the bottom cups.](/images/uploads/example_cup_stack.png){: class='w5 center db'}


<h4 class='tc'>Instructions/code</h4>

This is one way for the "robot" to stack the cups in the pattern shown above:

<div class='cb'>
    <img src='/images/uploads/up_arrow.png' alt='Arrow pointing up' class='w3 dib'>
    <img src='/images/uploads/right_arrow.png' alt='Arrow pointing right' class='w3 dib'>
    <img src='/images/uploads/down_arrow.png' alt='Arrow pointing down' class='w3 dib'>
    <img src='/images/uploads/redo_arrow.png' alt='Arrow pointing in a U-turn' class='w3 dib'>
</div>

<div class='cb mt4'>
