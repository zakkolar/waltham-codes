# forkphorus changelog

*Dates reflect when the changes were developed, and recent changes may not yet be deployed to forkphorus.github.io.*

## June 11

- SVG graphics actually scale
- Fix stages not being destroyed after you start a new one
- Add message to try to get people to use forkphorus.github.io instead of forkphorus.github.io/forkphorus/
- sb3: Fix support for that one trick people use to change the pen's transparency:
  - ![set pen color block](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17209175/59324756-e3bfc880-8ca5-11e9-9ec4-cf0871255709.png)

## June 10

- sb2 and sb3: Fix `play sound until done` not respecting `stop all sounds`
  - The sound would indeed stop, but the wait for the sound to finish would remain.
  - This probably fixes issues with sounds not playing until after a duration of time.
- Finishing up things related to the [HTML Packager](https://forkphorus.github.io/packager/)

## June 9

- Scratch 3 compiler optimizations: some scripts can run significantly faster than before!
  - Loops inside "Run without screen refresh" blocks can be optimized down to pure JS loops (significantly faster than continuations)
    - Quicksort on 200,000 went from ~.34 to ~.28
    - Insertion sort on 10,000 items went from ~2 to ~1.6
    - An empty "repeat 1,000,000" went from 0.013 to 0.002
    - Optimization might be disabled depending on the contents of the loop.
    - Each block must be independently marked as running without screen refresh to get these optimizations. (calling a block with screen refresh from a block without screen refresh is not enough)
  - Does not apply to Scratch 2 projects for now
