  <h1>Forkphorus & Android</h1>
  <p>This is a guide to packaging Scratch projects as Android apps using Forkphorus.</p>

  <p style="background:yellow; border: 3px solid red; padding: 4px;">WORK IN PROGRESS &mdash; Some steps are missing, and some steps are unclear. It will be improved in time.</p>

  <h2>Using the packager</h2>
  <p>Generate an HTML file using <a href="/packager/">the packager</a>.</p>
  <p>The only important part of this step is that <b>YOU MUST enable "Include CSP" under "Advanced Options"</b>.</p>

  <h2>Packaging it to run on Android</h2>
  <p>I'll be using <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a> to do this. I have also attempted to use PhoneGap to do this, however I wasn't able to get it to work. (it seemed to inject its own scripts inside of existing scripts, which caused a lot of errors.)</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Download Node.js</a> (and npm if it is not included)</li>
    <li>Get <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/">Android Studio</a> (you might be able to get by with just ADB/SDK? Not sure)</li>
    <li>Open a Command Prompt or Terminal and execute these commands to create a Cordova App:
      <ol>
        <li><code>npm install -g cordova</code></li>
        <li><code>cordova create MyApp</code></li>
        <li><code>cd MyApp</code></li>
        <li><code>cordova platform add android</code></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Delete everything inside the "www" folder created by Cordova. The template includes a lot of stuff we will not be using. (keep the "www" folder itself, but empty it out)</li>
    <li>Move the HTML file generated by the packager into the "www" folder, and rename it as "index.html"</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Running it in the emulator</h2>
  <p>This step is not necessary. It is useful to test if your project actually works in Cordova.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start the emulator</li>
    <li><code>cordova run android</code></li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Creating an APK</h2>
  <p>I don't personally know, but thankfully many other people have experience. I direct you to the vast knowledge base of the internet:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/35294815">How to create a signed APK file using Cordova command line interface? (stackoverflow)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://haensel.pro/apache-cordova/cordova-create-a-signed-release-apk-easy-howto">

      </a></li>
    <li>If those don't work, try <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=cordova%20generate%20apk">Google Search</a></li>
  </ul>
